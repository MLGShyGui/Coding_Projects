print("##### In Range #####")
# Let’s start the advanced challenge problems by testing if a number falls within a certain range. We will accept three parameters where the first parameter is the number we are testing,
# the second parameter is the lower bound and the third parameter is the upper bound of our range.
# Write your in_range function here:
def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if num >= lower and num <= upper:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your in_range function:
print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
# should print True
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))
# should print False


print("##### Same Name #####")
# We need to write a program that checks different names and determines if they are equal. We need to accept two strings and compare them.
# Write your same_name function here:
def same_name(your_name, my_name):
  if your_name == my_name:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your same_name function:
print(same_name("Colby", "Colby"))
# should print True
print(same_name("Tina", "Amber"))
# should print False


print("##### Always False #####")
# There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction.
# This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction.
# Write your always_false function here:
def always_false(num):
  return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False


print("##### Movie Review #####")
# We want to create a function that will help us rate movies. Our function will split the ratings into different ranges and tell the user how the movie was based on the movie’s rating.
# Write your movie_review function here:
def movie_review(rating):
  if rating <= 5:
    return "Avoid at all costs!"
  if rating > 5 and rating < 9:
    return "This one was fun."
  else:
    return "Outstanding!"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your movie_review function:
print(movie_review(9))
# should print "Outstanding!"
print(movie_review(4))
# should print "Avoid at all costs!"
print(movie_review(6))
# should print "This one was fun."


print("##### Max Number #####")
# For the final challenge, we are going to select which number from three input values is the greatest using conditional statements.
# To do this, we need to check the different combinations of values to see which number is greater than the other two.
# Write your max_num function here:
def max_num(num1, num2, num3):
  if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    return num1
  elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    return num2
  elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:
    return num3
  else:
    return "It's a tie!"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your max_num function:
print(max_num(-10, 0, 10))
# should print 10
print(max_num(-10, 5, -30))
# should print 5
print(max_num(-5, -10, -10))
# should print -5
print(max_num(2, 3, 3))
# should print "It's a tie!"
